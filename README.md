# Phase 4 project README

### MVP:

    * Users can view all characters, their info, stats and bio (from Resident Evil game series)
    * Client/Route set ups for a few frontend components such as user login/signup page
    * Users can essentially add characters to a "favorites list" or "liked list"
        -Only users who signup and have a profile can add characters and access the list (Authentication)
    * Users will remain signed in until they log out
    * One user (admin) is allowed to modify what's displayed directly (Authorization)
    * Full CRUD applied

## Stretch:

    *With cookies coded in, users will have up to 3-5 characters that they can view until they are
     prompted to signup and create a profile to continue
    * Users can simulate a battle between two characters
